    <h2>My Skills</h2>

    <h3>My Skill: Playing the Flute</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">One of my most treasured skills is playing the <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">flute</span>. The flute is an instrument that requires patience, breath control, and precision. Over the years, I have developed my ability to produce clear and melodic sounds. I practice daily to improve my technique, from mastering finger placement to refining my breathing control.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Playing the flute allows me to express emotions in a way words cannot. Whether I am playing a classical piece, a soft melody, or an upbeat tune, each note carries its own beauty. I have learned various playing techniques, such as <span class="italic">vibrato</span> and <span class="underline">staccato</span>, to add depth and style to my music. Performing in front of an audience has also boosted my confidence and stage presence.</p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Besides solo performances, I enjoy playing in groups and ensembles. The experience of harmonizing with other instruments creates a magical feeling. Learning new songs and compositions keeps me motivated, and I constantly challenge myself with more complex pieces. Playing the flute is not just a skill—it is a passion that brings me peace, joy, and personal growth.</p>



    <h3>My Hobbies: Singing and Reading Music Notes</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Music has always been a central part of my life, and two of my favorite hobbies are <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">singing</span> and <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">reading music notes</span>. Singing allows me to express my emotions freely, whether through slow ballads or energetic songs. I enjoy singing different genres, from classical to pop, and I constantly work on improving my vocal control.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Another important aspect of my musical journey is <span class="italic">reading sheet music</span>. Understanding musical notation helps me play and sing with accuracy. I love analyzing different music sheets, identifying key signatures, and interpreting rhythms. Reading music notes has deepened my understanding of musical structures and enhanced my ability to sight-read.</p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Practicing singing and reading music has also improved my ear training. I can now recognize pitch, melody, and harmony more effectively. I often challenge myself with new songs, experimenting with vocal techniques and different musical scales. Whether I am singing alone or with a group, music brings me a sense of fulfillment.</p>

    <h3>My Interest: The World of Music</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Music is more than just a hobby for me—it is a deep passion that influences every aspect of my life. I am fascinated by different musical styles, from <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">classical symphonies</span> to modern electronic beats. My interest extends beyond just playing and singing; I love studying the history of music, understanding its evolution, and discovering how different cultures have shaped it.</p>
